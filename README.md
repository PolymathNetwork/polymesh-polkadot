Forked from [polkadot-js/api](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) repository.

First commit [01/23/2020]

This library was created to provide a wrapper around all the methods exposed by Polymesh and polkadot/Substrate network and defines all the types exposed by a Polymesh node.

# Fork's Purpose

Polkadot/api comes packed with a kit of scripts that allows to build interfaces from scratch with a custom data source.
Our idea is customize some part of this code and process flow to generate interfaces with our needs, taking as data the Polymesh schema and our network metadata.
